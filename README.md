# Medical Center Management System

## Introduction

The Medical Center Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to efficiently manage healthcare clinics. It provides a user-friendly login interface with role-based access control, ensuring that administrators, employees, and doctors have access to their respective functionalities.

## Key Features

- Role-Based Access Control: The system classifies users into three roles: administrators, employees, and doctors. Each role has its specific privileges and responsibilities.

- Clinic-Specific User Management: Every clinic can manage its own set of users. This means doctors and staff members are associated with specific clinics, ensuring data privacy and access control.

- Medical Records: Doctors can easily add and manage medical records, including diagnoses, medical reports, and prescription medications. These records are securely stored and associated with specific patients.

- Patient History: The system allows doctors to retrieve complete patient histories. This means that when a patient returns, all previous medical information, diagnoses, reports, and prescriptions are readily available for reference.

## Technology Stack

- Programming Languages: The project is developed using C# and utilizes the power of SQL Server for data storage and management.

- Third-Party Libraries: We have employed the DevExpress library to enhance the user interface and provide a polished look and feel.

- Dataset Tool: We have also incorporated the Dataset tool, which plays a crucial role in data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of the system.
